                    <p class="hero-text">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've
                        made
                        the
                        big jump over to
                        the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                    <h3 class="hero-desc-title">How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                    <p class="hero-desc">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and
                        hours
                        learning, then try
                        to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing
                        projects.
                    </p>
                    <p class="hero-desc">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was
                        learning and most things
                        about my journey with the world.</p>

                    <h3 class="hero-desc-title">How I got started</h3>
                    <p class="hero-desc">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take
                        notes
                        about what I was
                        learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I
                        learned
                        but
                        also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                    </p>
                    <p class="hero-desc">That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my
                        learning summaries was
                        also
                        helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
